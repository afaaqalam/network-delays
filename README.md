# Network Delays
**End-to-end delay (d<sub>end-end</sub>)** is the amount of time taken for a packet to be transmitted across a network from source to destination.

## Components of Delay


- *Transmission delay (d<sub>trans</sub>)* - time it takes to push the packet's bits onto the link
- *Propagation delay (d<sub>prop</sub>)* - time for a signal to reach its destination
- *Processing delay (d<sub>proc</sub>)* - time routers take to process the packet header
- *Queuing delay (d<sub>queue</sub>)* -	time the packet spends in routing queues


> d<sub>end-end</sub> = d<sub>trans</sub> + d<sub>prop</sub> + d<sub>proc</sub> + d<sub>queue</sub>
